Notes for AKARI project

AKARI is Access Keeping And Regulating Instrument for Linux 2.6 kernels.

You can use AKARI for analyzing your system's behavior (i.e. reports which
application accesses which resources like strace command does) and optionally
restricting your system's behavior (i.e. controls which application can
access which resources like TOMOYO/AppArmor does).

AKARI is forked from TOMOYO 1.8 and made as a LKM (loadable kernel module)
so that you don't need to replace your kernels installed in your system.

This patch is released under the GPLv2.
